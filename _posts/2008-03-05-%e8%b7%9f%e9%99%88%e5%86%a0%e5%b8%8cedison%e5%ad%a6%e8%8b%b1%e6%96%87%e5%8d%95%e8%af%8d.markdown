title: 跟陈冠希(Edison)学英文单词
author: JohnnieFucker
excerpt: "作者：新东方 杨政\r\n前言：真的没想到陈冠希会用全英文做道歉陈述。他500多字的道歉信, 用词准确地道，词汇难度较高，包含了50多个考研(雅思)核心词汇，经过改编完全可以成为一篇高质量的完形填空，或阅读理解。Edison这小子虽然”猥琐”，但英文用词的难度达到了考研英语（国内最变态英语考试）的要求，如果参加雅思考试估计8分以上不成问题。陈已经决定推出香港娱乐圈，对于这样优秀的英语人才(ＹＺ门暂且不谈)，老俞是不是可以考虑挖到新东方来呢？估计轰动效应不亚于去年Sister

Today I have come back to Hong Kong to stand before you and account for myself. I have never escaped from my responsibility. During the past few weeks, I have been with my mother and my family and my loved ones to show support and care and at the same time to have them support and care for me.<br />
核心词汇解析<br />
account for 1) 说明，解释；2) 占…比例<br />
escape from从…逃脱, 推卸责任<br />
escape=es(ex=out) + cape(catch)<br />
I admit that most of the photos being circulated on the Internet were taken by me. But these photos are very private and have not been shown to people and are never intended to be shown to anyone. These photos were stolen from me illegally and distributed without my consent.<br />
核心词汇解析<br />
circulate = circul(circle圆圈) + ate v.循环，流通<br />
intend to v.打算去…<br />
illegal = il(not) + legal (合法的) + ly adv.违法地<br />
单词组记: distribute, contribute, attribute, tribute<br />

contribute = con(fully) + tribute vt.贡献; 投稿 [助记]全部都给了<br />
attribute to v.归因于<br />
tribute n.贡品，颂词 [助记] 给国王的礼物<br />

resent = re(against) + sent n.憎恨　[助记]　相对抗的情感= hatred<br />
sentimental[谐音]三屉馒头,失恋了只吃三屉馒头,所以是—a.多愁善感的<br />
There is no doubt whoever obtained these photos have them uploaded on the Internet with malicious and deliberate intent. This matter has deteriorated to the extent that society as a whole has been affected by this. In this regard, I am deeply saddened. I would like now to apologize to all the people for all the suffering that has been caused and the problems that have arisen from this. I would like to apologize to all the ladies and to all their families for any harm or hurt that they have been feeling. I am sorry. I would like to also apologize to my mother and my father for the pain and suffering I have caused them during the past few weeks. Most importantly, I would like to say sorry to all the people of Hong Kong. I give my apology sincerely to you all, unreservedly and with my heart.<br />

单词组记: libra天平, deliberate, liberate, liberty, libertine, libido<br />
一直到现在，英国的法院门口还站立着古希腊象征法律精神的正义女神(DICE)的雕像，她左手拿着神圣的天平Libra，象征着权衡和平等；右手拿着宝剑，象征着裁决和力量；眼睛被布蒙着，象征绝对的公正无私。<br />
deliberate = de(强调) + libera(=libra) + ate a. 深思熟虑的, 故意的 [助记] 把你的想法放在天平上称量，引申为深思熟虑的，深思熟虑的结果当然是故意的<br />
liberate = liber (自由=libera)+ ate vt.解放(让人民获得自由)<br />
自由和天平有什么关系呢？<br />
天平的主要作用就是要让两边重量相等，平等。解放全人类不就是让人民平等吗？人民解放军PLA：People’s Liberation Army liberation的职责就是解放全中国让中国人民平等自由<br />
liberty n.自由<br />
libertine这个单词叫”浪荡子”，原来就是“特别自由的人”的意思，” 挺（tin）自由（liber）的”<br />
libido弗洛伊德的著作里面，他造出一个表示“性动力”的单词libido（中文翻译成“利比多”），表达的就是这种本源的不受控制的力量。<br />

I know young people in Hong Kong look up to many figures in our society. And in this regard, I have failed. I failed as a role model. However, I wish this matter will teach everyone a lesson. To all the young people in our community, let this be a lesson for you all. This is not an example to be set for you.<br />

During my time away, I have made an important decision. I will whole-heartedly fulfill all commitments that I have to date. But after that, I decided to step away from the Hong Kong entertainment industry. I have decided to do this to give myself an opportunity to heal myself and to search my soul. I will dedicate my time to charity and community work within the next few months. I will be away from Hong Kong entertainment industry indefinitely. There is no time frame.<br />
核心词汇解析<br />

entertainment industry 娱乐业<br />
health =heal(恢复健康) +th(名词)<br />
heal (v.治愈，恢复) 是health的反向构词<br />
dedicate to 把…奉献给,投身于…<br />
charity = char(=care关心)+ ity(名词) n.慈善，慈善事业 [助记]关心穷人就是做慈善<br />
I have been assisting the police since the first day the photos were published and I will continue to assist them. After this press con., I have obligation to help them with their investigation and hope that this case can end soon as everyone I think has the same wish.<br />
核心词汇解析<br />
assist = as(to) + sist(stand) vt.(站在一旁来) 协助<br />
press con. = press conference 新闻发布会<br />
press free. = press freedom 言based on number of characters.论自由<br />
press 是“压”的意思，怎么会变成“新闻”，“言论”呢？<br />
因为最初的报纸都是油墨印刷,需要把纸紧紧的压在刻版上才能印刷出字来.所以press有了一个引申意:n.出版业,印刷业. 出版印刷业不就是发布新闻和言论的阵地吗?<br />
obligation n.义务<br />
investigation n.调查<br />
I would like to use this opportunity to thank the police for their hard work on this case. Thank you. I believe everyone’s priority now (and) my priority now is to stop the suffering and pain, for not letting this…we do not want to let this situation become more out of control. We need to protect all the innocents and all the young from matters like this. In this regard, I have instructed my lawyers to do everything possible within the law to protect all the innocents, victims of this case. I believe that a press statement is being issued as we speak on what my lawyers have advised me to do.<br />

And I apologize to everyone (who) has to go through this. I would like to also thank you for giving me this opportunity to say what I have wanted to say all along in my heart.<br />
