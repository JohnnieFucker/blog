When You Are Gone        By Avril Lavigne</p>
<p>I always needed time on my own</p>
<p>I never thought I'd need you there when I cried</p>
<p>And the days feel like years when I'm alone</p>
<p>And the bed where you lie is made up on your side</p>
<p>When you walk away</p>
<p>I count the steps that you take</p>
<p>Do you see how much I need you right now?</p>
<p>When you're gone</p>
<p>The pieces of my heart are missing you</p>
<p>When you're gone</p>
<p>The face I came to know is missing too</p>
<p>When you're gone</p>
<p>The words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it ok</p>
<p>I miss you</p>
<p>I’ve never felt this way before</p>
<p>Everything that I do reminds me of you</p>
<p>And the clothes you left, they lie on my floor</p>
<p>And they smell just like you</p>
<p>I love the things that you do</p>
<p>When you walk away</p>
<p>I count the steps that you take</p>
<p>Do you see how much I need you right now?</p>
<p>When you're gone</p>
<p>The pieces of my heart are missing you</p>
<p>When you're gone</p>
<p>The face I came to know is missing too</p>
<p>When you're gone</p>
<p>The words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it OK</p>
<p>I miss you</p>
<p>We were meant for each other</p>
<p>Out here forever</p>
<p>I know we were</p>
<p>All I ever wanted was for you to know</p>
<p>Everything I do I give my heart and soul</p>
<p>I can hardly breathe</p>
<p>I need to feel you here with me</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>When you're gone</p>
<p>The pieces of my heart are missing you</p>
<p>When you're gone</p>
<p>The face I came to know is missing too</p>
<p>When you're gone</p>
<p>The words I need to hear will always get me through the day and make it OK</p>
<p>I miss you</p>
